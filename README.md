Optimizes Visual Studio for video recordings, screen captures and screen sharing with a single click.

![Presenter Mode command](art/command.png)

It does that by:

1. Resetting font sizes
2. Zooms the editor
3. Applies the Blue theme
4. Resizes Visual Studio itself

This is all configurable, but defaults to settings that are optimized for screen recordings.
